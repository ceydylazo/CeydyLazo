About

Hello there. I'am a Belizean Scientist. I have made contributions to numerous Belizean conservation institutions as well as the scientific community.  I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology from the University of Belize and I am currently enrolled in a Fellowship Program at the University of Florida for a Masters in Biochemistry and Micriobiology. My research insterest are Immunopathology focusing in Hematology cancer, Gene mutation, Human Genetic Disorder and molecular medicine. I am very curios person, I like to understand how everything work and why they happen.  My interest in these areas first arouse in my undergraduate studies at the University of Belize where I took Molecular Biology. That same year my mother was diagnose with Metastatic breast cancer. As hard as it was emotionally, I found myself fascinated in understanding the cellular level of the disease.
